# SNAKE GAME
-- miejsce na zdjecie

### General info
This project is a modern take on the classic Snake game with several unique enhancements. It maintains the core mechanics of the original game while introducing new gameplay elements to enhance the experience.
This game was developed as a project during the first semester of Computer Science at Gdańsk University of Technology. The project instructions were written by Professor Dariusz Dereniowski
#### Key Features:

* Teleportation: The snake can teleport between predefined locations on the game board.

* Dynamic Speed Increase: The game continuously speeds up by a fixed value, making it progressively more challenging.

* Bonus Cherry Mechanic: The red cherry power-up introduces an element of unpredictability, as it can either slow down the game or reduce the snake’s length by one tile.

* Game State Management: Players can save their current game state and reload it during gameplay.

* High Score Tracking: At the end of each game, the highest achieved score is displayed.

* This project offers an exciting and challenging twist on the traditional Snake game, providing both new and experienced players with a fresh gameplay experience.

### Technologies
The project is created with:
* C/C++
* SDL2 library version
### Setup
To compile and run the game, you have two options:

* Using the Project Template: A project template is available on GitHub, which includes all necessary dependencies and configurations.

* Manual Compilation: You can compile the project in Visual Studio by linking the required SDL2 libraries and downloading the necessary bitmap assets.

Ensure that you have SDL2 properly installed before building the project.
### How to play
* Control the snake using the arrow keys.

* Blue cherries increase the snake's length and grant 1 point.

* Red cherries appear periodically and can either shrink the snake or slow down the game. Collecting one grants 5 points.

* Use teleporters to quickly move between locations on the map.

* Save your game progress by pressing the 'S' key.

* Load a previously saved game by pressing the 'I' key.

* Press 'ESC' to exit the game.

### Conclusions
The game is currently complete; however, in the future, it can be improved with the following features:

* Optimizing the movement model and eliminating the rapid-click bug.

* Adding new obstacles and mechanics to make the gameplay more challenging.
